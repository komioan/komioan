My name is Ioannis Komlikis, I have a BSc in Physics and and MSc in Nuclear Engineering and I have a developed a keen interested for programming
by focusing mainly in its applications in data science. Due to that, the programming language that I have beee working on is python and its libraries
associated mainly with data analysis (pandas, numpy,matplotlib,plotly, etc) and Machine learning (scikitlearn,pytorch, teensorflow)
in my github page you could find the projects and tasks I have worked on (I found most of these projects on online courses I followed ans some others through research).
